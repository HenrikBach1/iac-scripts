# Podman Container Scripts Documentation

This document lists all the Podman-based container scripts and their purposes.

## Installation Scripts

### `podman-install.yml`
Ansible playbook to install and configure Podman on Ubuntu systems.
- Adds Podman repository (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- Installs Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo without Docker compatibility
- Configures rootless operation
- Sets up registries and lingering for user containers

### `uninstall-podman-docker.sh`
Removes the `podman-docker` package, which provides the `docker` command as a Podman compatibility wrapper.
- Leaves `podman`, `buildah`, and `skopeo` installed
- Does not remove separately installed Docker packages
- Can be run repeatedly without failing if `podman-docker` is already absent

For a Docker installation that should no longer use Podman as its Docker endpoint,
use `uninstall-docker-podman.sh`. It also removes Podman `DOCKER_HOST` entries
from the known shell and environment configuration files.

An already-running shell can still retain an inherited `DOCKER_HOST` value.
Use `source docker-env.sh` to remove it from the current shell. The Docker
installation script cannot do this itself when executed normally, because a
child process cannot modify its parent shell environment.

### `setup-podman-user.yml`
Ansible playbook to configure Podman for a specific user.
- Creates Podman configuration directories
- Sets up storage and registries configuration
- Tests Podman functionality
- Provides troubleshooting guidance

### `yocto-in-podman-install.yml`
Complete Yocto development environment setup using Podman.
- Creates Yocto workspace directories
- Pulls CROPS/poky container image
- Creates and configures Yocto container
- Installs container management commands
- Creates project initialization scripts

### `ros2-in-podman-install.yml`
Complete ROS2 development environment setup using Podman.
- Validates ROS2 LTS releases
- Creates ROS2 workspace
- Pulls ROS2 container images
- Creates and configures ROS2 container
- Sets up ROS2 environment and build tools

## Container Management Scripts

### `start-yocto-container-podman.sh` ✅ **Recommended**
Main script for creating and managing Yocto containers with Podman.
- **Auto-installs Podman** if not available using `podman-install.yml`
- Creates CROPS/poky-based containers
- Mounts workspace directories with proper SELinux labels
- Sets up environment variables for Yocto development
- **Includes VS Code integration setup automatically**
- Uses `--restart` option instead of separate restart script
- Installs container commands
- Provides container status and connection info

## Connection Scripts

### `yocto-podman-connect`
Enhanced connection script for Yocto Podman containers.
- Starts container if not running
- Installs container commands automatically
- Provides Yocto-specific welcome message
- Handles container lifecycle

### `ros2-podman-connect`
Enhanced connection script for ROS2 Podman containers.
- Detects ROS2 distribution automatically
- Sources ROS2 environment setup
- Sets up workspace environment
- Provides ROS2-specific help and commands

## Utility Scripts

### `podman-exec-it`
Interactive Podman exec wrapper with enhanced functionality.
- Provides help, detach, stop, and bash commands
- Shows container status and available containers
- Mirrors Docker exec functionality
- Includes container command guidance

### `podman-exec-detached`
Detached Podman exec wrapper for background commands.
- Runs commands in background without blocking
- Ensures container stays running
- Uses container utilities if available
- Provides fallback implementation

### `ensure-yocto-container-commands-podman.sh`
Specialized script for installing container commands in Podman containers.
- Uses shared container-command-common.sh library
- Provides robust command installation
- Handles Podman-specific container access
- Ensures container commands are available

## VS Code Launcher Script

### `vscode-with-podman.sh` ✅ **Recommended**
Simple, fast VS Code launcher with Podman environment setup.
- Quick environment setup with minimal output
- Shows available containers and API status
- Launches VS Code with proper Podman integration
- Essential information display without verbose logging

**Usage:**
```bash
# Launch VS Code with Podman environment (current directory)
./vscode-with-podman.sh

# Launch VS Code with specific workspace
./vscode-with-podman.sh /path/to/workspace
```

**What this script does:**
- Export `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock`
- Start Podman socket service if needed
- Test Podman API connectivity
- Show available containers
- Launch VS Code with proper environment for Remote-Containers extension

> **Note**: The `setup-vscode-podman.sh` script has been removed as VS Code integration is now automatically handled by the container startup scripts.

## Shared Libraries

### Updates to `container-command-common.sh`
Added Podman support functions:
- `detect_container_type_podman()`: Detects container type for Podman
- `install_container_commands_podman()`: Installs commands in Podman containers
- Handles Podman-specific container operations
- Maintains compatibility with Docker functions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Yocto Development
```bash
# Install Podman
ansible-playbook podman-install.yml

# Set up Yocto environment
ansible-playbook yocto-in-podman-install.yml

# Connect to container
./yocto-podman-connect yocto-workspace-container

# Start development
cd /workdir
./init-yocto-project.sh
```

### Basic ROS2 Development
```bash
# Install Podman
ansible-playbook podman-install.yml

# Set up ROS2 environment
ansible-playbook ros2-in-podman-install.yml

# Connect to container
./ros2-podman-connect ros2-workspace-container

# Build workspace
colcon build
```

### Container Management
```bash
# Interactive access
./podman-exec-it <container-name> bash

# Run background command
./podman-exec-detached <container-name> "make -j4"

# Restart container
./restart-yocto-container-podman.sh yocto-workspace-container
```

## Key Features

### Rootless Operation
- No root privileges required
- No daemon running as root
- Better security isolation
- User-specific container storage

### SELinux Compatibility
- Proper volume labeling with `:Z` flag
- Works with enforcing SELinux policies
- Maintains security context separation

### Drop-in Docker Replacement
- Same command syntax as Docker scripts
- Compatible with existing workflows
- Shared container command system
- Consistent user experience

### Full Feature Parity
- All Docker script functionality available
- Same container commands (help, detach, stop, remove)
- Same workspace mounting patterns
- Same development environment setup

## Files Created

All Podman scripts are located in the same directory as Docker scripts:
- `/home/sad/projects/ansible/iac-scripts/`

The scripts follow the same naming conventions with `-podman` suffix or `podman-` prefix to distinguish them from Docker equivalents.
